# Request to Connect Regarding the "memwave" GitHub Handle

Hi,

I hope this message reaches you well.

I'm working on a new project called **MemWave**, and Iâ€™ve noticed that this GitHub handle is registered but unused. I would be very grateful if you'd be open to transferring the namespace.

You can reach me at:

ðŸ“§ **m@memwave.com**  
ðŸ”— [memwave.com](https://memwave.com)  

Thanks either way â€” wishing you all the best with your projects.

â€“ Marius
